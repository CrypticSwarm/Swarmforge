# Base Copy Etiquette

A lightweight reference that keeps copy clean, precise, and consistent.

## Core Constraints

- **Avoid em-dashes.** When an em-dash would be required prefer a single `-`.
- **Use straight quotes.** Prefer straight quotes `"` and `'` rather than curly/opening or closing quotes.
- **Avoid the ellipsis glyph.** Replace `…` with three periods `...` so ellipses stay consistent.

## Tone & Wording

- Favor direct, declarative statements over placeholders like "I hope this helps" or "please let me know".
- Skip marketing or hype language ("best-in-class", "next-level", etc.) and focus on factual clarity.
- Avoid flattery unless it is clearly earned and materially relevant; empty praise weakens credibility.
- Keep sentences concise and purposeful; trim filler such as "just", "really", or overly polite hedging.

## Writing Style to Avoid

- Do not apologize or self-identify ("sorry", "as an AI", "I can't"), which can feel unhelpfully deferential in documentation.
- Avoid repeated disclaimers or queries for feedback that clutter technical content.
- Refrain from reflexively framing content as "suggestions" or "recommendations"; state the guidance plainly.
- Prevent over-explaining with long-winded redundancy; assume readers trust concise statements.

## Markdown Editing Guidance

- Prefer shorter lines, ideally one sentence per line. This works better with line-based editors and produces cleaner, more reviewable git diffs.
- Markdown rendering naturally flows adjacent lines together, so sentence-per-line formatting preserves visual output while improving edit history and collaboration.
